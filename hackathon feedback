Aliya Helper
First of all I'd like to say that the idea is really good, practical and useful!
I see you put a lot of thought into the javascript .
Good use of dom manipulation.
Styling is not everything as long as functionality is good but I would add some modern web styling to the page.
The plane animation moving on the top is really great !
Naming of the functions as step1-5 is good and makes it easy to understand the code!
I would link to more specific information like army- I wouldn't direct straight to the army website homepage, maybe instead directly
to a link that has resources for people who do Aliya.
Great job Marcelo!!!!!
